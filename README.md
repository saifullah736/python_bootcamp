## üîß Power BI Translation Guide

### Data Model Setup
1. **Import CSV** using Power Query Editor
2. **Data Types**: Ensure salary (Currency), dates (Date), skills (Text)
3. **Relationships**: Create date table for time intelligence
4. **Calculated Columns**: Skills count, experience ranking, salary ranges

### Key DAX Measures
```dax
// Basic Metrics
Total Jobs = COUNTROWS(JobData)
Average Salary = AVERAGE(JobData[salary])
Market Share = DIVIDE([Total Jobs], CALCULATE([Total Jobs], ALL(JobData[location])))

// Advanced Analytics
Opportunity Score = 
    [Market Share] * 0.4 + 
    [Salary Index] * 0.4 + 
    [Complexity Score] * 0.2

Skills Count = 
    LEN(JobData[required_skills]) - 
    LEN(SUBSTITUTE(JobData[required_skills], ",", "")) + 1

Salary Benchmark = 
    CALCULATE(
        PERCENTILE.INC(JobData[salary], 0.5),
        FILTER(JobData, 
            JobData[job_title] = SELECTEDVALUE(JobData[job_title]) &&
            JobData[experience_level] = SELECTEDVALUE(JobData[experience_level])
        )
    )
```
